# Hey I'm Rehan 👋

I enjoy building AI Agents.

Most of my work revolves around solving problems that I face day to day. I enjoy building customer applications and integrating them with habits in our daily lives.

I like to keep my architecture and solutions simple, and only add complexity when necessary.
