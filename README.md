# Hey I'm Rehan 👋

I enjoy building AI Agents.

I enjoy building applications that solve problems we face in our daily lives.

I like to keep my system architecture and solutions simple, and only add complexity when necessary.

🧠 **AI Agents:** single-agent, multi-agent, MCP-based, voice agents, local or cloud agents  
📦 **Ready-to-run examples:** clone → install → run  
🛠️ **Dev workflows:** how to structure agents, handle tools, logs, evaluation, and planning
