# Hey I'm Rehan 👋

I build enjoy building AI Agents.

Most of my work revolves around solving problems that I face day-to-day. I enjoy building on customer applications, and integrating them with habits in our daily lives. 

I like to keep my architecture and solution simple, and only add complexity when necessary.

##What I work on:

###🧠 AI Agents: single-agent, multi-agent, MCP-based, voice agents, local or cloud agents
###📦 Ready-to-run examples: clone → install → run
###🔧 Dev workflows: how to structure agents, handle tools, logs, eval, planning
